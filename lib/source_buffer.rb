class SourceBuffer

  # TODO: Implement buffer that will deal with SourceSocket.



  # TODO: Methods that need to be implemeneted:
  #
  #   * set(buffer) - Takes SourceBuffer object
  #   * reset()
  #   * remaining_bytes()
  #   * get(length) - Takes amount of bytes to get from buffer.

  #   SPECIFIC DATA TYPES (unpack from front of buffer)
  #   * get_byte()  - Gets first byte from buffer.
  #   * get_short() - Gets two bytes from buffer
  #   * get_float() - Gets four bytes from buffer (Floating decimal)
  #   * get_ulong() - Gets four bytes from buffer (Unsigned Long Integer)
  #   * get_string() - Gets a null-terminated string from buffer.  Will require a loop (can't unpack this!)
